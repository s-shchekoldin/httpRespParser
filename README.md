This is a demonstration of using the HttRresponse parsing example.
The code (httpResp.h and httpResp.cc) was automatically generated using vProto at https://vsyn.ru
Code generation was based on the description in httpResp.vproto.
The application demonstrates the operation of both: full-http request and any byte-level data fragmentation.
