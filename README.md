This is a demonstration of using the HttResponse parsing example.
The code (httpResp.h and httpResp.cc) was automatically generated using vProto at https://vsyn.ru
The application demonstrates the operation of both: full-http and any byte-level data fragmentation.

The application uses input test data from 'input.txt' and outputs the result to the file 'output.txt'.
